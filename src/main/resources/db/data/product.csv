Compatibility: Unlike desktop drives, these hard drives are tested for compatibility with NAS systems to ensure optimal performance.

Reliability: The continuous operation of a NAS or RAID is extremely demanding. Desktop drives are typically not designed and tested for these conditions - unlike the WD Red Plus. Troubleshooting protocols: WD Red Plus NAS hard drives are specifically designed with RAID troubleshooting protocols to help reduce NAS system failures. Noise and Vibration Protection: Desktop drives are designed for single drive operation and therefore typically offer little or no protection against noise and vibration found in multi-drive systems. WD Red Plus hard drives are optimized for use in NAS environments with multiple drive bays.",282,8,6,43,ec4f2ad2-c5e1-4bba-93b8-d469b7c35e4d.png,0,299

Just take them out of the charger and they're ready to use with your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac. With a tap of a finger, you set up the AirPods and they work like magic. They're automatically turned on and always connected. The AirPods even detect when they're in your ears and pause when you take them out. To adjust the volume, change the song, call someone or get directions, say 'Hey Siri' and what you want to do. You can wear just one or both AirPods and double-tap to play a track or skip to the next when listening to music or podcasts. AirPods offer 5 hours of playback and 3 hours of talk time per charge. And with a charging case that holds additional charges for 24 hours of playback, they'll keep up with whatever you're doing. Need a quick charge? After just 15 minutes in the charging case, you can listen to 3 hours of music or talk for 2 hours. Controlled by the new Apple H1 chip, AirPods use optical and accelerometry sensors to tell if they're in your ear. The H1 chip automatically routes audio and activates the microphone - whether you use both AirPods or just one. And when you're on the phone or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer with speech recognition and wavefocused microphones help reduce outside noise and make your voice clearer.
